## 📝 7. Reverse Integer
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.  
**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**  

#### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

#### Constraints:
+ `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

## 📝 Solution
```php
class Solution {

    const MIN = -2147483648;
    const MAX = 2147483647;

    /**
     * @param Integer $x
     * @return Integer
     */
    function reverse($x) {
        
        // Convert to string and reverse
        $num = (int)strrev((string)$x);

        // During string reverse we lost the potentional negative number
        // Aka -320 was converted to just 320, so we need to make sure we have the right number (if it was negative)
        $num = $x < 0 ? -1 * $num : $num;

        // Check if its outside 32-bit range
        $num = $num > SELF::MAX ? 0 : $num;
        $num = $num < SELF::MIN ? 0 : $num;

        return $num;
    }
}
