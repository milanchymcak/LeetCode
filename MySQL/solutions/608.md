## 📝 608. Tree Node  
Table: `Tree`  

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.

```
     
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:  
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.  
Return the result table in **any order**.  
The query result format is in the following example.  
     
  
#### Example 1:  
![608. Tree Node](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/22/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: 
Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.

```
#### Example 2:  
![608. Tree Node](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/22/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

```
  
#### Constraints:  
+ **"Leaf"**: if the node is a leaf node.  
+ **"Root"**: if the node is the root of the tree.  
+ **"Inner"**: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.  
  
## 📝 Solution 
```sql  
# Write your MySQL query statement below  
SELECT   
    id,  
    CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'  
        WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Inner'  
        ELSE 'Leaf'  
    END AS type  
FROM tree  
ORDER BY id ASC;  
```
